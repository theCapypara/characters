  description: >
    The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of
    thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving
    throw or be restrained by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has
    advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

    While restrained by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its
    turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to
    make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

    At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage
    increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
