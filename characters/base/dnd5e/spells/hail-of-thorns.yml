  description: >
    The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain of
    thorns that sprouts from your ranged weapon or ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the attack, the
    target of the attack and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
    1d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

    At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10
    for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).
