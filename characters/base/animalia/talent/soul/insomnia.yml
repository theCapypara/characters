  description: >
    No matter what you do you find it near impossible to sleep.
    You can not gain the benefits from a full rest, however you can use this newfound down time to do other
    things that are calming and relaxing such as doing activities with your gear or studying.
    After doing down time activities for at least 6 hours all effects that are reset with a full rest become reset
    such as talents or items with limited uses. This does not reset HP.
