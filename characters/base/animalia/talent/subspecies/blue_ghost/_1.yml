  description: >
    Eyesight is important for all creatures, male Reticulata have this talent in spades.

    If you are a male Reticulata you can see in the dark.
    In pitch black you can see things as if it were mid day. You can not see color, but rather everything is in black and white.

    If you are a female Reticulata then you have great skills when it comes to digging.
    You add twice your arm skill when digging rather than adding it once. You also can dig a minimum of 2 cubed feet in half an hour.
