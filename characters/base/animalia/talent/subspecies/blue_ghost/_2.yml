  description: >
    You can cause your abdomen to glow brightly lighting up the area around.
    Using one action point you can activate your light (it can be either green or blue).

    This glow lights up the area around you for 30 feet as if it were bright light and an additional 20 feet after
    that as if it were dim light. If you glow for over 2 hours your glow will fade and you will be unable to glow till
    the end of your next full rest. You can change your glow's color without using action points once per round.
