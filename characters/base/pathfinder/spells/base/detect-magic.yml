  description: >
    You detect magical auras. The amount of information revealed depends on how 
    long you study a particular area or subject.

    1st Round: Presence or absence of magical auras.

    2nd Round: Number of different magical auras and the power of the most potent aura.

    3rd Round: The strength and location of each aura. If the items or creatures bearing the auras 
    are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of 
    magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level 
    for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its 
    properties (see Spellcraft).
