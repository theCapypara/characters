  description: >
    When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures 1d8 points 
    of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, 
    this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. 
    
    An undead creature can apply Spell Resistance, and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.
