        backstory: >
          Arran grew up in the city of Misty Gales Town. He lived in the east part
          of the town and was raised by a Grumpig named Narrat.
          He helps cooking with Narrat but often screws things up. He always
          dreamt of joining a guild when he was finally old enough. Now was
          the time!

          He doesn't known his parents or what happened to them... or why he
          is being raised by Grumpig. Narrat avoids the question when asked.
          He is often in the western part of the city and watches the bird Pokémon
          flying from their tree top houses and plays with his best friend Tom,
          which he met at the school. He would love to fly. Often he just tries
          to fly by jumping from low branches.

          He is being rediculed by a Yanmega named Lando for that. He knows
          him back from school and because he and his gang are regular customers
          of his adoptive father's diner.
          One day he decided to finally join the guild! He had made plans with Tom
          to join together, but one day he and his family had to move away in a rush.

          Tom's parents were always strange... What did they hide?
          Anyway.... So he had to join alone...

      class_abilities:
        - |
          Rage: While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
          - You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
          - When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
          - You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
        - >
          If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
          Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
          haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then.
          You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have raged the number of times shown
          for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before
          you can rage again.
        - >
          Unarmored Defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
          Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
        - >
          Danger Sense: At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be,
          giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against
          effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded, deafened,
          or incapacitated.
        - >
          Reckless Attack: Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce
          desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.
          Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
          rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.
      feats: []
      inventory:
        on_hand:
          - name: Haxorus Tusk
            notes: Normally used for chopping wood in the town, it’s still good for combat. 1d8 slashing damage, can be 1d10 when used with two hands.
          - name: Pot Lid
            notes: You couldn’t afford Bracers, so you grabbed the only thing you could that nobody would miss. Surprisingly, it’s still effective enough. Gives you +1 AC.
          - name: The rest of the pot too
            notes: Given to you after Narrat realized you took the pot lid.
          - name: Gravelrock
            count: 9
            notes: A bit of a heavier throwable, but you’re strong enough that you can manage it decently well. The range is 60/100 and you deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage with your throws.
          - name: Canteen
            notes: Filled with water from the Caldwelch River so you can have a nice drink.
          - name: Recipe Book
            notes: Gives you proficiency when making checks while cooking. You aren’t sure why, but you imagine a Buneary would have liked this at some point in time.
          - name: Tuba
            notes: You’re welcome
          - name: Feather Pen
            notes: A nice writing implement
          - name: Ink
            notes: A nice way to write. The ink is rather old, though, but it still works
          - name: Blank piece of parchment
            notes: A nice thing to write on
          - name: Small pouch filled with food ingredients
            notes: While together, they’re rather bland, if you or someone else cooks them, you have about three days worth of food and rather good food at that.
          - name: Roc’s Feather
            notes: Magic item, attunable. A feather Tom gave you after seeing you jump and fall off the tree houses trying to fly. Allows you two spells per day. You can cast the Jump spell once per day, and you can also cast the Feather Fall spell once per day. The feather recharges both of these at dawn.
