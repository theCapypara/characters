        backstory: |
          From a young age Maurice was a curious boy, always wanting to understand everything.
          Once he grew up, he became a scientist, mostly involved in studying spirits and ghosts, and how the
          body and soul function together. He is working on a way to enter the world of afterlife without dying.

          Currently he is in need of money, to fund some materials he needs for his research, so he takes on
          research missions every once in a while, those have the added bonus of sometimes aiding him in his
          own research too.
